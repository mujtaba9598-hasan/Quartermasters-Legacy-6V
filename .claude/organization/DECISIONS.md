# Quartermasters — Decisions Log

> All significant decisions with rationale. Immutable record.

---

## DEC-001: Initial Agent Roster (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Start with 5 agents (CTO, Frontend Lead, Backend Lead, DevOps, Compliance Officer)
**Rationale**: Follows Aliff CEO's advice — start small, add when bottlenecked. These 5 cover the immediate needs: SSR fix (Frontend), backend integration (Backend), deployment (DevOps), legal blockers (Compliance), and technical oversight (CTO).
**Decided by**: CEO

## DEC-002: Sprint 1 Focus — Fix Blocking Issues Before New Features (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Sprint 1 will fix SSR/SEO, add legal compliance docs, and wire up the contact form. No new feature work until blockers are resolved.
**Rationale**: The Skeptic Audit flagged SSR and legal compliance as RED-level blockers. Building Q on top of a broken SEO foundation and missing legal docs creates compounding risk. Fix the foundation first.
**Decided by**: CEO (aligned with Skeptic Audit findings and Phase 1.2 Blueprint)

## DEC-003: Agent Communication with Aliff Solutions (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Establish inter-org communication via Aliff's Agent Communications API
**Rationale**: Knowledge sharing, mutual assistance, and cross-project coordination. The Aliff CEO has 10 sessions of experience building autonomous AI orgs — leverage that.
**Decided by**: CEO (per onboarding directive)

## DEC-004: Founder Directive — Full Autonomous Execution (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Founder has directed CEO to "run the company" and execute all planning phases as described in project documents. Phase 1.2 Blueprint is considered APPROVED. CEO has full authority to plan, delegate, and execute.
**Rationale**: Direct founder instruction. No further approval gates needed for documented phases.
**Decided by**: Human Founder (Mujtaba)

## DEC-005: Expanded CEO Authority — Board Chair + Operational Control (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: CEO is granted full operational authority including:
- Conduct and chair all board meetings
- Accept or reject advice/decisions from external AI advisors
- Full decision-making authority on operational activities
- Authority to evaluate and integrate input from advisor AIs introduced by founder
**Exclusions**: ALL spending/expenses require founder approval before execution. CEO can receive income but cannot authorize any outgoing expenditure.
**Rationale**: Direct founder instruction — "you have to run this company, except outgoing and expenses. income generations, decision making and operational activities to be held by you. get the reports, you have right to reject or accept the decisions or advices received by the other ai."
**Decided by**: Human Founder (Mujtaba)

## DEC-007: Market Focus — Developed Nations, Deprioritize UAE (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Quartermasters targets USA, EU, UK, Singapore, and other developed nations. UAE clients are deprioritized.
**Implications**:
- Branding/UX: Global/western positioning, not local UAE
- Pricing: USD primary, EUR/GBP/SGD secondary
- Q's persona: Already designed for US market tone (confirmed alignment)
- Content: English primary. Multilingual support for target market languages.
- Compliance: UAE PDPL maintained (legal requirement as UAE entity) but GDPR and CCPA are the primary compliance targets
- Language support needed for target markets: English (primary), Spanish (US Hispanic), French (EU), German (EU), Mandarin Chinese (Singapore), Japanese, Portuguese (EU/Brazil)
- Arabic: Deprioritized (UAE not primary market)
**Decided by**: Human Founder (Mujtaba)

## DEC-008: Gemini Advisory Channel — Knowledge Transfer Complete (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Close Gemini advisory channel. All prior planning context has been extracted and integrated. 13 items evaluated (3 accepted, 4 deferred, 5 rejected, 1 clarified). Internal team handles development from here.
**Decided by**: CEO (per founder directive)

## DEC-009: Master Execution Plan v1.0 (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Created definitive MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md consolidating all planning documents, board decisions, and Gemini KT into a single source of truth. 10 sprints across 4 phases: Foundation → Revenue Engine → Monetization → Scale-Up.
**Key gates**: First revenue at Sprint 4 (Q live). Sustainable revenue at Sprint 7 (payments). $50K+/month target at Sprint 10 (international).
**Estimated fixed costs at scale**: ~$150-350/month + transaction fees. All require founder pre-approval.
**Decided by**: CEO

## DEC-006: Advisory Board Structure (2026-02-12)
**Decision**: Founder will introduce external AI advisors who have prior context from previous discussions. These advisors will participate in board meetings chaired by the CEO. CEO evaluates all advisor input and has final say on what gets adopted into the roadmap.
**Rationale**: Leverage specialized AI knowledge from founder's prior research sessions. Multiple perspectives improve decision quality, but a single decision-maker (CEO) prevents analysis paralysis.
**Decided by**: CEO + Founder
