- Three Shader Language (TSL) replacing raw WGSL/GLSL for cross-renderer compat
- React Three Fiber (R3F) supports WebGPU via gl prop
- Compute shaders enabling real-time particle systems, physics, procedural generation
- Three.js: tens of millions npm downloads/month, 25% increase in job listings (2025)
- Project timelines: 3-8 weeks hero visuals, 8-16 weeks advanced, 16-28 weeks complex

## AI Integration Status
- Work & Co: CodeSail (proprietary AI for backend code acceleration)
- R/GA: Acquired Addition AI studio, AI cut character creation from 15 days to 2 days
- Huge: 62% clients on AI/GenAI (up from 25% in June 2024), Huge IX division
- Active Theory: AI chat navigation on portfolio site (not a full host/concierge)
- BASIC/DEPT, Instrument: No public AI-first features on own sites as of Feb 2026

## Key Insight
None of these agencies position AI as a front-door experience on their own website. They sell AI services TO clients but do not demonstrate AI mastery through their own digital presence. Active Theory's AI chat is the closest, but it is a navigation aid, not a full RAG-powered knowledge host.
